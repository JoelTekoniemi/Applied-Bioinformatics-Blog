# Nextflow

## Pipeline setup
It is pretty easy to setup nextflow pipelines with the help of nf-core, but there is nonetheless some configuration that is needed:
- Create Pixi environment
	- add channels conda-forge and bioconda `-c conda-forge -c bioconda`
	- add packages nextflow and nf-core
- Create data folder and other necessary folder for pipeline
	E.g. genome, results, 
	Symbolic link `nl` for data to avoid copying
- Navigate to the nf-core pipeline and use the installer

Example using the rna-seq pipeline

pixi run nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.19.0 -resume -params-file nf-params.json -c hpc2n.config

## Fancy stuff
- tags: tags are shown next to processes when running pipeline
- workflow.onComplete: more info and user-friendly messages upon completed workflow
