# Workflows

Workflow / pipeline = many scripts (usually one per tool), deployed one after the other

Workflow managers help to connect scripts in a pipeline, with automatic control over resource allocation and error management, e.g. re-submitting a batch job with double memory if it failed.

## Nextflow
Open-source workflow manager.
Channels: contain data, input / output
Process: scripts

Queue channel: unidirectional FIFO queue, can be read only once in the pipeline

Value channel: can be read multiple times

Execution abstraction

### Example for srun:
`srun -A project_ID -t 15:00 -n 1 fastqc --noextract -o fastqc data data/sample_1.fastq.gz data/sample_2.fastq.gz`
 
—> mix of information about command and info about script in the same line
In Nextflow, these are separate. Executor: determines how the script is run in the target platform

## Netflow scripts
1. Adding variables into channel
—> Channel.of()

2. Defining process blocks
Channel operators can be used on channels
Input can be value, file, path, etc. —> the variable type is specified
Output is similar, can also be “stdout” which is just the terminal output

3. Workflow block

Modify and resume
Runs are cached, and the output can be retrieved using the -resume flag, instead of rerunning the whole script.
Double-dashes can be specified to change nf process parameters: --greeting ‘Bonjour le monde’ —> changes params.greeting.

## Cleanup
nextflow log: see run history
nextflow clean: deletes project cache and working directories.
	-before: cleans up previous runs
pixi run nextflow clean -before <RUN NAME> -f

## RNA-seq pipeline
Executor setup in nextflow.config
Processes: slurm as executor + time, cpus, etc.
Other statements:
• Resume
• Singularity containers
• Executor account: E.g. HPC2N 

## nf-core

Community nextflow pipelines with extensive documentation.

Interesting pipelines
• rnaseq: classic RNA-seq, provides gene expression matrix as output 
• pixelator: Pixelgen MPX/PNA data
• raredisease: variant calling and scoring from WGS/WES from rare disease patients

# AI in Bioinformatics
We ended the day with a short discussion about use of LLMs in bioinformatics.
